Welcome to my [personal portfolio website](https://m4milaad.github.io/Resume)! This project showcases my work as an aspiring software developer and features a unique blend of modern web design and retro-inspired 3D graphics. Below, you'll find details about the development process, key features, and how to explore the site.

## 🔥 Features
- **Dual Interface Design**:
    - **Modern Interface**: A clean, user-friendly layout inspired by [Brittany Chiang's website](https://brittanychiang.com/). This section presents all the essential information in a straightforward, easily navigable format.
    - **Retro 3D Interface**: An interactive retro-styled terminal interface inspired by [Ed Hinrichsen website](https://www.edwardh.io/). This section features a fully functional terminal on a 3D-rendered vintage computer screen.

- **3D Rendering**:
    - **WebGL2-Powered**: The retro side of the website uses WebGL2 for rendering, written entirely from scratch.
    - **Custom Shaders**: Includes custom shader effects, shadow maps, and other advanced graphics techniques.
    - **.OBJ and .MTL File Loader**: A custom loader for 3D models, allowing for dynamic content.
    - **Handcrafted Models**: All 3D models used in the project were created by me.

- **Interactive Terminal**:
    - Explore the retro interface by typing commands into the terminal. Navigate through files, discover information, and enjoy a nostalgic trip back to the early days of computing.

- **Fully Static and Front-End Only**:
    - The site is a static front-end project, hosted on GitHub Pages. No back-end or server-side code is used.
